### SOLUTION


Any issues you found in the app which you needed to fix

First is the setup of the repo, inclulding the packages
Second is I did not able to properly work the order by feature on the filter itself. 
3rd I encouter some issue on preserving the ui because whenever i tried to closed there is one record that has alwawys populate on the search bar or when I refresh and its frustrating why it happend like that. but eventually i figure it out and search some ideas in the community in stackoverflow. 

The reasoning behind the approach you took 

When I assessing the requirements Im thinking which is the best approach for filters and the table list displayed on ui page. 

First is i did breakdown what are the high level usable approach for both filters and vulnerable list view table

such as State management but along the way this state management changes overtime
handling of submission, event handlers, and given there is UI I just improve it using some css and adjust the className to be readable and work as my expected based on the requirement. 

Things you would ordinarily do in your day-to-day work do but didn't do here

Things I ordinarily do in my day to day work, is to clarify the requirements and criteria of a userstory, but on this pretty straightforwarad. in my day to day activity, as much as possible I'll reach out with the business analyst, we will chunk all the requirements into a task, which applied in here. I do also love team work or having a call with the codeveloper for transfering knowledge for what I did on the task. or ask some complex questions to have different eye and angle on the approach. given that this is a assessment so I am the only person who can think and assess how was my work. 


General comments about the challenge

The challenge is pretty good and challenging for a different chunk of requirements, and assessment tested my approach and exceeded some of the knowledge, but so far it was good and atleast i did applied some of the criteria base on the requirements. 


Any compromises you had to make.

compromises I think when I tried to check the possibility solution on the specific feature which in order by, but still I exceed the research, and last thing i need to check is on chatgt, because i am team player but this time i need someone t o talk but chatgpt is better than people because of accuracy and better explanation of the issue. as much as possible I'll tried to check first what is the best approach, i just did on my notepad, is there any libraries or plugin i need to use on this kind of requirements. but while developing, you purely did based on the available. but at the end of the day order by still not able to work properly because of a limited time. 

But I truly enjoy the process of making this. but in reality you need tools for your development task and to be effecient on your job is to use some usable tools like chatgpt, stackoverflow and some offices, and some organizer for you to easily think whats best on the requirement.
